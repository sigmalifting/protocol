## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I import my existing spreadsheets?

No. SigmaLifting can only import data that follows the SigmaLifting protocol format. Currently, the only way to create compatible spreadsheets is to build your program in the app first, then export it.

### What's the difference between JSON and XLSX export?

- JSON export: Machine-readable format, best for data parsing
- XLSX export: Human-readable spreadsheet, perfect for sharing with training partners

Both formats contain your complete program data and can be imported back into the app with identical results.

### Do I need to understand the technical specification to use the app?

No. The technical specification is for developers who want to build tools that work with SigmaLifting data. Regular users just need to use the app's interface.

### Why can't I sync data between devices?

SigmaLifting is designed to work 100% offline with no accounts or cloud storage. Your data stays private on your device. To transfer data between devices, export your programs/processes and import them on the other device.

### What's the difference between a Program and a Process?

A Program is a training template that contains all the structure and logic of your training plan - think of it as a framework with formulas. While programs can be reused, they're not fixed; you can modify them at any time to adjust your training approach. A Process is a running instance of that program, like a calculator based on the program's formulas, where you log your actual workouts. You can run the same program multiple times, with each process tracking its own workout data and progress.
